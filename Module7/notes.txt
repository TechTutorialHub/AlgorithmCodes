A greedy algorithm makes the locally optimal choice at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It builds a solution incrementally, choosing the next step that offers the most immediate benefit.

Components :

Candidate Set: The pool of choices (e.g., edges in a graph).
Selection Function: Chooses the best candidate (e.g., smallest weight).
Feasibility Function: Ensures the candidate contributes to a valid solution.
Objective Function: Assigns a value to a solution (e.g., total weight).
Solution Function: Determines when a complete solution is found.

Advantages :

Simple to implement.
Efficient.

Disadvantages :

Does not guarantee optimal solutions for all problems (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem).
