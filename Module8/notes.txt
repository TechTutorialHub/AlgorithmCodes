Module 8

Dynamic programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve optimization problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems. 
Unlike divide-and-conquer, DP stores the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations, making it highly efficient for problems with overlapping sub-problems.
