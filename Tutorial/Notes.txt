## 2. Brute Force Algorithms

- **Definition:**  
  A straightforward approach based directly on the problem’s statement and definitions.

- **Strengths:**  
  - Simplicity and wide applicability.
  - Easy to implement for small input sizes.

- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Often inefficient for large inputs.
  - May yield unacceptably slow solutions.

- **Examples:**  
  - **Selection Sort:** Repeatedly finds the minimum element and places it at the beginning.
  - **Brute-force String Matching:** Compares the pattern with every substring.
  - **Exhaustive Search:** For problems like Traveling Salesman and Knapsack.

## 3. Divide and Conquer Algorithms

- **Definition:**  
  Breaks a problem into smaller subproblems, solves them independently, and then combines their solutions.

- **Steps:**  
  1. **Divide:** Break the problem into subproblems.  
  2. **Conquer:** Solve each subproblem recursively.  
  3. **Merge:** Combine the solutions to form the final result.

- **Examples:**  
  - **Merge Sort:** Divides the array, sorts each half, and merges them.
  - **Quick Sort:** Partitions the array around a pivot and recursively sorts the subarrays.
  - **Binary Search:** Recursively searches in the sorted array.
  - **Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication:** Reduces multiplication count by splitting matrices.
  - **Closest Pair of Points:** Uses a recursive approach to find the smallest distance.

## 4. Decrease and Conquer Algorithms

- **Definition:**  
  Solves a problem by reducing it to a smaller instance of the same problem and extending the solution.

- **Approaches:**  
  - **Top-Down:** Recursion based.  
  - **Bottom-Up:** Iterative, starting from the smallest instance.

- **Variations:**  
  1. **Decrease by a Constant:**  
     - **Examples:** Insertion Sort, DFS, BFS, Topological Sorting.
  2. **Decrease by a Constant Factor:**  
     - **Examples:** Binary Search, Fake-Coin Problem.
  3. **Variable-Size Decrease:**  
     - **Examples:** Computing the median, Euclid’s Algorithm.

- **Example – Insertion Sort:**  
  - Builds a sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its proper place.
  - **Time Complexity:** Best: **O(n)**; Worst/Average: **O(n²)**.

- **Graph Traversals:**  
  - **DFS:** Uses a stack (or recursion) for depth-first exploration.
  - **BFS:** Uses a queue for breadth-first exploration.

## 5. Transform and Conquer Algorithms

- **Definition:**  
  Transforms a problem into a simpler or more convenient instance before solving it.

- **Variations:**  
  1. **Instance Simplification:**  
     - *Presorting:* Sorting data to simplify further operations (searching, median finding, etc.).
     - *Gaussian Elimination:* Transforming a system of equations into an upper triangular matrix.
     - *Balanced Search Trees:* AVL trees, which are self-balancing binary search trees.
  2. **Representation Change:**  
     - Changing the way data is represented to make it easier to solve.
  3. **Problem Reduction:**  
     - Transforming the problem into another problem for which an efficient algorithm exists.

- **Example Applications:**  
  - **Presorting:** Improves efficiency of search algorithms (e.g., binary search).  
  - **Gaussian Elimination:** Used for solving linear equations.  
  - **AVL Trees:** Enable efficient searching in large databases.

## 6. Greedy Algorithms

- **Definition:**  
  Constructs a solution by making the locally optimal choice at each step, with the hope of finding the global optimum.

- **Core Components:**  
  1. **Candidate Set:** Available choices.  
  2. **Selection Function:** Chooses the best candidate.  
  3. **Feasibility Function:** Checks if a candidate is valid.  
  4. **Objective Function:** Evaluates a solution.
  5. **Solution Function:** Determines when the solution is complete.

- **Advantages:**  
  - Easy to implement.
  - Often faster and simpler compared to exhaustive methods.

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - May not always produce the optimal solution.
  - Proving correctness can be challenging.

- **Example Algorithms:**  
  - **Prim’s Algorithm:** Constructs a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) by adding the smallest edge connecting the tree to a new vertex.  
    - **Time Complexity:** **O(n²)** (can be improved with advanced data structures).
  - **Kruskal’s Algorithm:** Sorts edges and adds the smallest one that doesn’t form a cycle.  
    - **Time Complexity:** **O(E log E)**.
  - **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path from a source to all other nodes.  
    - **Time Complexity:** **O(V²)** or **O(V log V)** with a priority queue.

## 7. Dynamic Programming (DP)

- **Definition:**  
  A technique that breaks problems into overlapping subproblems, solves each subproblem only once, and stores their solutions using **memoization**.

- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **Optimal Substructure:** An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.
  - **Overlapping Subproblems:** Subproblems recur many times.
  - **Memoization:** Saving solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant work.

- **Example Problems:**  
  1. **Fibonacci Number Series:**  
     - **Naïve Recursive Approach:** Exponential time due to repeated calculations.
     - **DP Approach:** **O(n)** time using memoization or bottom-up methods.
  2. **Knapsack Problem:**  
     - Determine the most valuable subset of items that fit into a knapsack.
     - **DP Time Complexity:** **O(nW)**.
  3. **Tower of Hanoi:**  
     - Recursive puzzle with **O(2ⁿ)** time complexity.
  4. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:**  
     - Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
     - **Time Complexity:** **O(V³)**.
  5. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**  
     - Though often considered greedy, it also leverages DP concepts for shortest paths.
  6. **Project Scheduling:**  
     - Optimizes resource allocation over time.
