Brute Force

Brute force is a straightforward approach to solving problems by systematically checking all possible solutions. It is based directly on the problem's statement and definitions.

Strengths:

    Wide applicability: Can be applied to almost any problem.

    Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.

    Reasonable for small problems: Works well for problems like matrix multiplication, sorting, and searching.

Weaknesses:

    Inefficiency: Often results in slow algorithms, especially for large problems.

    Not constructive: Doesnâ€™t provide insights into the problem structure.
